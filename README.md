## About
Get vid from Youtube ...

## What
* Simple commandline application
* Fast and comfort usage

## Note
It is still work in progress. Here are some features that
need to be added later.

* Download higher res with audio
  * With high res like 1080p, audio and video are stored seperately
* Some exception are not correctly handled, because yes

Additionally, as mentioned earlier, there is a setting file, it is called
`prop.cfg`, you can change the settings but i would suggest to not change the
`mime_type`, if you do not know the streams. You can see the different streams
of the video, if you enable debug. I think the rest speaks for itself.

## Install
* Install python runtime environment, if you haven't already
* Download with git or as zip
* Run `prepare.bat`

## How to get vid
* Run Down.bat
* Enter Link
* Enter Name
* It then repeats itself because of the batch script

Thanks to pytube & pydub & ffmpeg ❤️ ...
